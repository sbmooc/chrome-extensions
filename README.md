# Chrome Extensions

A collection of useful (to me) Chrome extensions.

## Extensions

### GitHub PR Markdown Copy

A Chrome extension that copies GitHub pull request titles and links as markdown with a single click.

## Installation

To install any of these extensions locally:

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** by toggling the switch in the top right corner
3. Click the **Load unpacked** button
4. Select the extension directory (e.g., `github-pr-markdown-copy`)
5. The extension will appear in your Chrome toolbar

## Enabling Developer Mode

Developer mode is required to load unpacked extensions that haven't been published to the Chrome Web Store. This allows you to:

- Test extensions during development
- Use custom extensions without publishing them
- Modify and reload extensions instantly

**Note:** Extensions loaded in developer mode will show a warning on Chrome startup. This is normal and can be dismissed.

## Usage

### GitHub PR Markdown Copy

1. Navigate to any GitHub pull request page
2. Click the extension icon in your toolbar
3. The PR title and link will be copied to your clipboard as markdown format: `[PR Title](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123)`
4. Look for the green checkmark (âœ“) to confirm successful copy
